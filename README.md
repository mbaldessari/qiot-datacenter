# Hybrid Cloud Community Pattern qiot-manufacturing-datacenter-installer

This repository is based on the qiot-manufacturing-datacenter-installer that can be found in
the [qiot-data-center-installer](https://github.com/qiot-project/qiot-manufacturing-datacenter-installer) that has been
converted to use the Validated Patterns framwork.

The components in this community pattern are now installed using the openshift-gitops ArgoCD implementation.
The state of the pattern is now strictly found in the manifests in *git*.  The validated patterns framework
has been committed to GitOps as a philosophy and operational practice since the beginning.
The frameworkâ€™s use of ArgoCD as a mechanism for deploying applications and components is proof of our
commitment to GitOps core principles of having a declared desired end state, and a designated agent to
bring about that end state.

## Prerequisites

  - A deployed OpenShift cluster via IPI or UPI
    - The IPI installer will create all the proper components needed to run an OpenShift cluster.

  - When using UPI the cluster will need access to the following services:
    - DNS
    - Storage
    - Configure DHCP.
    - Provision required load balancers.
    - Configure the ports for your machines.
    - Ensure network connectivity.


## How to deploy

There are two ways of deploying this community pattern.

1. From the command line by executing **make install**
2. Installing the Validated Patterns community operator and creating a pattern instance.

### Command Line deployment

You will need to install the **make** utility in order to start the deployment from the command line.

Fedora and Red Hat Linux:
```sh
sudo dnf install make
```

You will also need to set the **KUBECONFIG** environment variable or login using the **oc login** command.

```sh
export KUBECONFIG=<cluster-config-dir>/auth/kubeconfig
```

```sh
oc login --token=<<USER_TOKEN>> --server=https://api.<<CLUSTER_ADDRESS>>:6443
```


## Cleanup

There are a few ways to do the cleanup.  This will be detailed at a later time.
